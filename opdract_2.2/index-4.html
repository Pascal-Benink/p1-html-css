            <h2>
                What is HTML?
            </h2>
            Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br> It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>
                What are HTML-Elements?
            </h2>
            Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>
                What is a tag?
            </h2>
            An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>
                How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?
            </h2>
            The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended the data to appear on the screen.

            <h2>
                More Elements
            </h2>
            <h3>
                A-tag
            </h3>
            The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other areas within our own web page). <br> You will always see the ‘a’ element used with the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.
            <br><img src="./img/001.png" alt="">
            <h3>
                Img-tag
            </h3>
            This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which points to the address of the image to be displayed. <br> NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
            <br><img src="./img/002.png" alt="">
        </p>
